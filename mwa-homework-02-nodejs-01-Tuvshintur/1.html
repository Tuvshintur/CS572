        1.1. setTimeout is schedule function that related with Web API which is executed after given time. 
            When the line of code executed it will scheduled in Web API then pushed in to Macrotask queue.
            For the event loop it will added to the timers(1) phase.
            
            setImmediate is schedule function that described in NodeJS which is schedule a callback
            to the check phase of event loop and the check phase will executed after poll phase ends. 

            In order to execute setImmediate's callback before setTimeout's callback, I need lines of code that works with I/O (poll phase).
        
        1.2. process.nextTick is not part of event loop which is asynchronous API. The process.nextTIck will fires immediately on same phase
            no matter which phase event loop is in. setImmediate is part of event loop that related with check phase of event loop. 
            The setImmediate will fires on the next tick. 
            The usage of process.nextTick is handle errors or cleanup unusable resources.
